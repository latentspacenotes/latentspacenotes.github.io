# AI In Action | 2024 Week 37

This week's meeting is a discussion about AI-powered IDEs and related tools, featuring three participants: KBall, Phlo, and Yikes.

## Initial Setup and Discussion

* Phlo compares PearAI to Cursor, finding it similar but lacking features like Cursor's "Composer" mode and advanced autocomplete.
* The discussion touches on the slowing pace of model advancements and the focus shifting towards application layer innovations. 
* They express excitement about OpenAI's new o1 model and Qwen2-VL for their reasoning capabilities and video understanding respectively.

## PearAI Demo

* Phlo demonstrates PearAI, highlighting its VS Code fork nature and features like a larger chat window button. 
* He attempts to use PearAI to translate a shell script into Python, comparing the experience to Cursor.
* The discussion revolves around PearAI's strengths and weaknesses compared to Cursor, with Cursor's "Composer" mode and Cursor's proprietary models emerging as a significant differentiator.

## NeoVim and Composer Discussion

* The conversation shifts to NeoVim as a customizable IDE alternative, emphasizing its keyboard-centric workflow and potential for speed.
* Yikes recommends LazyVim and Kickstart for learning NeoVim and precog.nvim for mastering keybindings.
* They discuss the value of NeoVim in building a personalized development environment tailored to individual preferences.

## Composer Demo

* Phlo showcases Cursor's "Composer" mode using a website redesign project. He demonstrates how to:
    * Use "Control-K" for in-file code edits based on prompts.
    * Use "Control-L" for chat-based interactions with the model to refine code.
    * Use "Control-I" for multi-file edits or creating new files with Composer mode.
* They discuss Composer's ability to handle multi-file edits and the importance of providing context for larger code bases.

## Open Source Alternatives and Conclusion

* Yikes recommends openv0.dev, and gptengineer.app as open-source alternatives to v0.dev for front-end development.
* The participants discuss the benefits of the weekly AI In Action livestreams, with Yikes highlighting the value of learning from others' experiences and discovering new tools.
* The session concludes with plans for Yikes to demo Melty and NeoVim configurations in the following week.

We enjoyed exploring the evolving landscape of AI-powered IDEs, showcasing demos, sharing recommendations, and emphasizing the importance of community engagement in driving innovation.
